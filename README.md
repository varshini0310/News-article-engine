# Simple News Search Engine

## Overview

This Simple News Search Engine will pull top news articles using NewsAPI, the articles will then be web-scraped using BeautifulSoup, and sentiment analysis will be performed on the returned data. If the user searches, a TF-IDF value will be calculated and returned, this will rank the news articles based on relevance to the search. Note, titles have higher weight.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Users can enter a search query to find relevant news articles.
- **Sorting Options**: Users can sort the search results by TF-IDF score, sentiment score, or sentiment label.
- **Pagination**: Users can load more articles in increments or load all articles at once.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Each article is analyzed for sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).
- **Article Descriptions**: A brief description of each article is displayed.
